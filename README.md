# Mouseplate — Disney Dining Plan Calculator & Trip Logger

Mouseplate is a Flutter app that helps Disney World guests determine whether a dining plan is "worth it" for their trip, then plan and log meals during their vacation. It compares the cost of dining plans (Quick-Service, Standard) against estimated out-of-pocket spending, and tracks credit usage in real time.

**Status:** Phase 1 complete with full local-first persistence. No backend required.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter + Dart (Material 3 design)
- **Navigation:** `go_router` (centralized routing)
- **State Management:** Provider + `ChangeNotifier` (AppController)
- **Storage:** `shared_preferences` via LocalStorageService (local-first)
- **Platforms:** Android / iOS / Web
- **PDF Export:** `pdf` + `printing` packages

### Codebase Structure

```
lib/
├── pages/              # Full-screen UI (onboarding, dashboard, log, settings)
├── widgets/            # Reusable components (app shell, restaurant picker)
├── controllers/        # AppController (single source of truth)
├── models/             # Trip, UsageEntry, PlannedMeal, PartyMember
├── services/           # LocalStorageService (data persistence)

├── theme.dart          # Material 3 colors + typography
└── nav.dart            # GoRouter configuration
```

### Key Models

- **Trip:** Immutable; stores party size, dates, dining plan choice, party members, planned meals, assumptions
- **PartyMember:** Individual guest profile (name, eating style, snacks/day, dessert & alcohol preferences)
- **PlannedMeal:** Scheduled restaurant visit (date, type, credits, estimated value)
- **UsageEntry:** Logged meal (type, timestamp, restaurant/note, value, credits)

### Single Source of Truth

`AppController` in `lib/controllers/app_controller.dart` owns:
- Current trip
- Usage log
- Computed totals (used/remaining credits, worth-it analysis)
- Premium flag & onboarding status

All UI listens via `Provider.watch<AppController>()`.

## Recent Fixes & Improvements (Session Summary)

### Bug Fixes
1. **Snack price mismatch** — Onboarder used $7/snack vs Trip model's $9/snack → Fixed to $9 everywhere
2. **Child signature dining pricing** — Used `60 × 0.6 = $36` vs Trip's `$28` → Fixed to use consistent child TS value
3. **Planned meal credit loss** — Signature dining created TS planned meals on QS plans (no TS credits) → Now only create when plan includes TS
4. **Onboarding reset on edit** — Jumping back from review and continuing lost all customizations → Fixed by preserving drafts when jumping back
5. **Unused variables & imports** — Cleaned up linter warnings

### Features Completed
- **Per-person party profiles** in onboarding (name, eating style, snacks/day, dessert & alcohol)
- **Signature Dining cost estimation** (2-credit restaurants)
- **Cash mode** dashboard variant (no credit counters, shows dining budget instead)
